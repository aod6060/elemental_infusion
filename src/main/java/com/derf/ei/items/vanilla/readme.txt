This package contain vanilla item that I've rewritten. If an item class isn't in this package then I'm using
forge's api for it. All of these class have most of the functionality that the initial MC class. However, 
contain several optimizations and tweaks to them that improves on these class overall. All of these rewrites 
are for my needs so if you want to use these you can but you might want to change them for your needs.
