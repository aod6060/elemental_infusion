This is a list or ore to ingot recipes for my smelterly can
take. This list will be added as a issue later. My smelter 
uses a custom recipe system that uses the ore dictionary to
figure out what ore and ingot can be smelted. This machanic
will have 2x, 3x, and 4x smelting ore to ingots. Here's the
current list.
