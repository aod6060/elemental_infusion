# Elemental Infusion

## What is Elemental Infusion
This is a simple mod for Minecraft 1.9. So what does this mod do exactly. Well it kind of between a techmod and magic mod. For one you have to collect elemental dusts to advance your career as a elementalist. There are four elements (fire, water, air, and earth) to both create items and machines to do stuff. Because I'm in the early stages of this mod I'm not really sure what I'm going to add. Plus my objective with this mod is to have fun. :)

## Note:
This mod is a WIP (Work in progress) mod. Its not complete so be vary wary 
to install it into your mod pack or you own instance of minecraft. If something
doesn't work, well, you know. I'm still working on it so I'll get to it. Please
don't flood my issues section for the moment unless it really necisary. I'm 
constantly testing this using the forge developer kit (whatever you call it) for
both client and server side. So I'll probably find it and fix right then and there.
If its exteemly serious I'll get to it. It won't be instantly. Please be patient.

## Branch 1.9
After doing some reviewing of minecraft 1.9. I've decided to push to a new branch. This new branch will 
have everything for 1.9. This is going to be my default branch from now on. Well until a new update like
1.9.1 or a major update like Minecraft 1.10, when ever this comes out.
